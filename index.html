    This document specifies a JSON based format to describe installable web
    applications. In addition, a set of JavaScript APIs are described that
    allow web content to trigger installation of such applications, as well as
    manage them on behalf of the user.

    <h2>App Manifest</h2>

    <p>An application <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON file describing an
    installable web application. This JSON file consists of a top-level object
    and several properties.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Example</h2>

      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <p class="note">
        All leaf properties MUST contain string values.
      </p>

      <h3>Mandatory Properties</h3>

      <ul class="properties">
        <li><dfn>name</dfn>: The name of the web application in the default
        locale. Maximum length is 128 characters.</li>

        <li><dfn>description</dfn>: A short description of the web application
        in the default locale. Maximum length is 1024 characters.</li>

        <li><dfn>default_locale</dfn>: [Mandatory only if "locales" property is
        set]. The locale of the top-level name and description.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optional Properties</h3>

      <ul class="properties">
        <li><dfn>launch_path</dfn>: The path within the web application's
        origin that is loaded when the application is launched.</li>

        <li><dfn>icons</dfn>: A map of icon sizes to URIs of the icons (which
        may be absolute, relative or data URIs). Icons MUST be square. Paths
        beginning with "<code>/</code>" are treated as relative to the origin
        of the app.</li>

        <li><dfn>type</dfn>: Determines how this app and the manifest will
        be verified by the runtime, and what security policy will apply.
        See <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Security#Types_of_applications">
        types of applications</a>, for a more detailed description. The value
        for this property MUST be one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>web</dfn>: A regular web app, may be self hosted or
            distributed by an app store. All permissions are opt-in at install
            and runtime, limited to permissions enumerated in the manifest.
            If the <a>type</a> property is not specified, this will be the
            default value.</li>

            <li><dfn>privileged</dfn>: An authenticated application approved by
            an app store. Equivalent in functionality and security to apps on
            other mobile platforms, but is required to be approved by an app
            store after a code review or some equivalent risk management
            process. At install, app assets are verified &amp; remain stored
            locally in a package. Requires a Content Security Policy, and
            all explicit permissions are requested at runtime, showing user the
            app's data usage intentions, and persisted by default.</li>

            <li><dfn>certified</dfn>: This category is reserved for apps that
            require approval by a device vendor or equivalent party due to risk
            of device corruption or risk to critical functionality. These
            include apps such as the system settings app, default dialer
            (to ensure emergency services are always accessible), core radio
            and power management, etc. Not intended for 3rd party applications.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>developer</dfn>: Information about the developer of the
          application, suitable for display.

          <ul>
            <li><dfn>name</dfn>: The name of the developer.</li>

            <li><dfn>url</dfn>: A URL pointing to the developer's website</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>locales</dfn>: A map of locale specific overrides of data
          contained in the manifest. Each locale key is keyed on a locale tag
          [RFC4646], and contains a sparse representation of the manifest. Any
          field in the <a>locales</a> property will override the corresponding
          property in the manifest. The <a>locales</a>,
          <a>installs_allowed_from</a>, and <a>default_locale</a> CANNOT be
          overridden. If the <a>locales</a> property is set, the
          <a>default_locale</a> MUST also be set.
        </li>

        <li><dfn>installs_allowed_from</dfn>: An array of origins that are
        allowed to trigger installation of this application. This field allows
        the developer to restrict installation of their application to specific
        sites. If the value is omitted, installs are allowed from any
        site.</li>

        <li>
          <dfn>appcache_path</dfn>: The absolute path to the application cache
          (<a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/offline.html#appcache">AppCache</a>)
          manifest. When an app is installed, the AppCache manifest will be
          fetched and parsed, and its static assets under the CACHE header will
          be cached.
        </li>

        <li><dfn>version</dfn>: A string that represents the version of this
        manifest. The User-Agent does not interpret this value in any way and
        is opqaue to everyone but the application itself. The field is provided
        to help the developer deal with various update cases, which will be
        discussed in following sections.</li>

        <li><dfn>screen_size</dfn>: This object may contain the
        <code>min_height</code> and <code>min_width</code> properties that
        describe the minimum height and width (in pixels) the application needs
        in order to render correctly. Interpretation of these values is left up
        to the runtime and/or app store.</li>

        <li><dfn>required_features</dfn>: This array consists of a set of
        values that describes the mandatory features the application needs in
        order to run correctly. A full list of valid values is TBD.</li>

        <li><dfn>orientation</dfn>: This value defines the orientation with
        which the application will initially start. If a value is provided,
        the runtime SHOULD ensure that the viewport rendering the application
        will adhere to the specified value, even if the device is rotated at an
        angle different from the specified value. The default behavior SHOULD be
        to rotate the viewport at an angle that best fits the orientation of the
        device, and MUST change as the user spatially rotates the device. The
        value MUST be one of <dfn>portrait</dfn>, <dfn>landscape</dfn>,
        <dfn>portrait-primary</dfn>, <dfn>portrait-secondary</dfn>,
        <dfn>landscape-primary</dfn> or <dfn>landscape-secondary</dfn>. The
        options suffixed with "-secondary" imply a 180 degree rotation from
        the options with the "-primary" suffix, for instance, holding the phone
        upside down (but still in a manner where <code>width &lt;
        height</code>), implies the <a>portrait-secondary</a> orientation.</li>

        <li><dfn>fullscreen</dfn>: This value MUST be set to either
        <dfn>true</dfn> or <dfn>false</dfn> to describe whether the runtime
        should launch the application in fullscreen mode.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Serving Manifests</h2>

      <p>An application manifest MUST be served from the same origin that the
      application itself is served from. There MUST only be one application per
      origin.</p>

      <p>When served as a static file, it is RECOMMENDED that the manifest be
      stored with the extension <code>.webapp</code>. The manifest MUST be
      served with a <code>Content-Type</code> header of
      <code>application/x-web-app-manifest+json</code>. It is RECOMMENDED that
      manifests be served over SSL.</p>

    <section>
      <p>A privileged caller is a web page that has been explicitely authorized

      below.</p>

        manifest from the provided URL, verify that it is valid, and then ask
        for permission from the user to allow installation to proceed. The
        User-Agent must also persist the parameters provided (if any) which may
        later be retrived from the <code>AppObject</code> representing this
        application. The user may choose to whitelist certain origins to allow
        them to install applications without any permission prompts.</dd>
